        <p>My research focuses on <a href='science.php'>extragalactic stellar populations</a>, large groups of stars in nearby galaxies, and their differences with those that form our own galaxy, the Milky Way. More specifically, I investigate the fundamental distribution of stellar masses of stars in nearby galaxies, otherwise known as the Initial Mass Function (IMF), and develop <a href='instrumentation.php'>astronomical instrumentation</a> to further our understanding of these stars.</p>
	<p>During my doctoral research, I integrated the study of the IMF in nearby galaxies and the development of novel astronomical instrumentation. My analysis focused on a detailed comparison of particular IMF-sensitive absorption features to state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis models using an MCMC fitting method. As part of my research, I took a leading role in the development of the recently commissioned Wide Integral Field Infrared Spectrograph (WIFIS) on the 2.3 meter Steward Bok Telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona. WIFIS is in the spring of 2017, which has recently begun accepting proposals from researchers outside the main instrument group.</p>
    <div class="post-title"><h2>About</h2></div>
        <p> In my free time I engage in indepentent, public data science projects and avidly discuss Toronto sports, politics, space science, and exploring the local food scene. I recently started to pursue photography as a hobby and hope to share some photos in the near future. </p>
        <p>In addition to my research, I love to participate in and manage astronomy public outreach events. I was an executive member of the <a href='http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/astrotours/'>UofT AstroTours</a> organizing committee for several years and have given my own public talks for AstroTours and other local events including several panel discussions. If you are interested in inviting me to talk about my research, astronomy, or anything else, please contact me at the address to the right.</p>
